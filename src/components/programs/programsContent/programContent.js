            Institution building is the basis of Africa redemption and the lack
            of it will be its demise.
            <br />
            An African-centered education must build on the foundations of
            traditional African concepts of education. These traditions must
            also be modified to reflect contemporary concerns and issues, but
            the return to the African view of the universe is imperative. When
            that worldview is restored, the problem of African liberation will
            become clear and, thus, the agenda and curricula of African
            education will be given the direction that seems so elusive at
            present.
            <br />
            As a principal tool for alienating Africans from their indigenous
            cultures, the goal of colonial education was to affect a profound
            loss of self-esteem and self-identity among a new African elite.
            <br />
            Radical African education will also expose racism as a scourge that
            is capable of taking on a multiplicity of forms, from the most
            discreetly concealed to the most bloodthirsty, as in the case of the
            slave trade and the Second World War. Like a living fossil, it bides
            its time, buried in the subconscious of hundreds of millions of
            people, until it re-awakens in the shape of pseudo-scientific
            doctrines and claims; for example, that everything remarkable about
            Africa must be of foreign origin, because Africans themselves have
            never invented anything.

            Political Program- To Build a Pan Africanist struglle
          </h3>
          <h4 className="programs-content-info-h4">PanAfricanism</h4>
          <p className="programs-content-info-p">
            In the nearly half century between 1900 and 1945, various political
            leaders and intellectuals from Europe, North America, and Africa met
            six times to discuss colonial control of Africa and develop
            strategies for eventual African political liberation. In the article
            that follows, historian Saheed Adejumobi describes the goals and
            objectives of these six Pan African Congresses and assesses their
            impact on Africa.
            <br />
            Pan-Africanist ideals emerged in the late nineteenth century in
            response to European colonization and exploitation of the African
            continent. Pan-Africanist philosophy held that slavery and
            colonialism depended on and encouraged negative, unfounded
            categorizations of the race, culture, and values of African people.
            These destructive beliefs in turn gave birth to intensified forms of
            racism, the likes of which Pan-Africanism sought to eliminate.
            <br />
            As a broader political concept, Pan-Africanism’s roots lie in the
            collective experiences of African descendants in the New World.
            Africa assumed greater significance for some blacks in the New World
            for two primary reasons. First, the increasing futility of their
            campaign for racial equality in the United States led some African
            Americans to demand voluntary repatriation to Africa. Next, for the
            first time the term Africans, which had often been used by racists
            as a derogatory description, became a source of pride for early
            black nationalists. Hence, through the conscious elevation of their
            African identity, black activists in America and the rest of the
            world began to reclaim the rights previously denied them by Western
            societies.
            <br />
            In 1897, Henry Sylvester-Williams, a West Indian Barrister, formed
            the African Association in London, England to encourage Pan-African
            unity; especially throughout the British colonies.
            Sylvester-Williams, who had links with West African dignitaries,
            believed that Africans and those of African descent living in the
            Diaspora needed a forum to address their common problems. In 1900,
            Sylvester-Williams organized the first Pan-African meeting in
            collaboration with several black leaders representing various
            countries of the African Diaspora. For the first time, opponents of
            colonialism and racism gathered for an international meeting. The
            conference, held in London, attracted global attention, placing the
            word “Pan-African” in the lexicon of international affairs and
            making it part of the standard vocabulary of black intellectuals.
            <br />
            The initial meeting featured thirty delegates, mainly from England
            and the West Indies, but attracted only a few Africans and African
            Americans. Among them was black America’s leading intellectual,
            W.E.B. DuBois, who was to become the torchbearer of subsequent
            Pan-African conferences, or congresses as they later came to be
            called. Conference participants read papers on a variety of topics,
            including the social, political, and economic conditions of blacks
            in the Diaspora; the importance of independent nations governed by
            people of African descent, such as Ethiopia, Haiti, and Liberia; the
            legacy of slavery and European imperialism; the role of Africa in
            world history; and the impact of Christianity on the African
            continent. Perhaps of even greater significance was the formation of
            two committees. One group, chaired by DuBois, drafted an address “To
            the Nations of the World,” demanding moderate reforms for colonial
            Africa.
            <br />
            The address implored the United States and the imperial European
            nations to “acknowledge and protect the rights of people of African
            descent” and to respect the integrity and independence of “the free
            Negro States of Abyssinia, Liberia, Haiti, etc.” The address, signed
            by committee chairman DuBois as well as its president Bishop
            Alexander Walters, its vice president Henry B. Brown, and its
            general secretary Sylvester-Williams, was published and sent to
            Queen Victoria of England. The second committee planned for the
            formation of a permanent Pan-African association in London with
            branches overseas. Despite these ambitious plans, the appeals of
            conference participants made little or no impression on the European
            imperial powers who controlled the political and economic destiny of
            Africa.
            <br />
            It was not until after World War I that DuBois revived the
            Pan-African congresses. Following the war, European and American
            politicians gathered for a peace conference in Versailles, France.
            DuBois, who attended the conference as a special representative of
            the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
            (NAACP), appealed to President Woodrow Wilson. In a letter to
            Wilson, he urged the American government to initiate a comprehensive
            study of the treatment of black soldiers. Moreover, DuBois expressed
            hope that the peace treaty would address “the future of Africa” and
            grant self-determination to the colonized peoples. President Wilson
            subsequently released a Fourteen Point memorandum, which suggested
            the formation a League of Nations and called for “an absolutely
            impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based on the principle
            that the interests of the population must have equal weight with the
            equitable claims of the government.” Although historians have
            questioned the impact DuBois’s request had on Wilson’s Fourteen
            Point memorandum, it was apparent that the loudest voice on behalf
            of oppressed blacks in the New World and colonized Africa belonged
            to the participants of the Pan-African Congress.
            <br />
            Galvanized by the gathering of world leaders and the discussion of
            colonial Africa’s future, DuBois proposed the formation of a
            Pan-African Congress. In 1919, as the Versailles Peace Treaty
            deliberations ran their course, DuBois, with the support of Blaise
            Diagne, a member of the French Parliament from the West African
            colony of Senegal, and funding from African American civil rights
            and fraternal organizations such as the NAACP, the Elks, and the
            Masons, convened a Pan-African Congress in Paris. The Congress,
            attended by approximately sixty representatives from sixteen
            nations, protectorates, and colonies, however, was more “pan” than
            African since most of the delegates had little, if any, first-hand
            knowledge of the African continent. Prominent American attendees
            included black members of the NAACP such as John Hope, president of
            Morehouse College, and Addie W. Hunton, who had served with black
            troops in France under the auspices of the Young Men’s Christian
            Association (YMCA), as well as white NAACP members, such as the
            Columbia University professor Joel Spingarn, the socialist William
            English Walling, and the socialist muckraking author Charles Edward
            Russell. Among the other delegates from the United States were
            Roscoe Conklin Simmons, a well-known black orator; Rayford W. Logan,
            who had served with the U.S. Army in France; black women’s rights
            activist Ida Gibbs Hunt; and Dr. George Jackson, a black American
            missionary in the Congo.
            <br />
            Conference participants adopted a resolution calling for the
            drafting of a code of law “for the international protection of the
            natives of Africa.” Other demands called for direct supervision of
            colonies by the League of Nations to prevent economic exploitation
            by foreign nations; to abolish slavery and capital punishment of
            colonial subjects who worked on the plantations of European colonial
            powers in Africa, especially in the Belgian Congo; and to insist on
            colonial peoples’ right to education. Moreover, the gathering
            stressed the need for further congress meetings and suggested the
            creation of an international quarterly, the Black Review, which was
            to be published in several languages. While congress attendees
            insisted that African natives should be allowed eventually to
            participate in their own government, they did not demand African
            self-determination. Despite the moderate nature of the demands, the
            European and American powers represented at the Versailles Peace
            Conference remained noncommittal.
            <br />
            The Pan-African Congress reconvened in London in August 1921 and a
            month later in Brussels, Belgium. Both meetings featured
            representatives from the Americas, the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa
            who echoed earlier Pan-Africanist reformist ideas, denouncing
            imperialism in Africa and racism in the United States. Moreover, the
            delegates demanded local self-government for colonial subjects and
            DuBois stressed the need for increased interracial contacts between
            members of the black intelligentsia and those concerned about the
            political and economic status of colonial peoples.
            <br />
            In 1923, the Pan-African Congress met in two separate sessions in
            London and in Lisbon, Portugal. Noted European intellectuals such as
            H.G. Wells and Harold Laski attended the London session. Several
            members of previous meetings participated in the deliberations that
            addressed the conditions of the African Diaspora as well as the
            global exploitation of black workers. While some scholars argue that
            the 1921 and 1923 congresses were effective only in keeping alive
            the idea of an oppressed people trying to abolish the yoke of
            discrimination, others claim that the international gatherings laid
            the foundation for the struggle that ultimately led to the political
            emancipation of the African continent.
            <br />
            Delegates reconvened for a fifth Pan-African Congress in New York in
            1927. The congress featured 208 delegates from twenty-two American
            states and ten foreign countries. Africa, however, was represented
            only sparsely by delegates from the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone,
            Liberia, and Nigeria. The small number of African delegates was due
            in part to travel restrictions that the British and French colonial
            powers imposed on those interested in attending the congress, in an
            effort to inhibit further Pan-African gatherings. Most of the
            delegates were black Americans and many of them were women. The
            congress was primarily financed by Addie W. Hunton and the Women’s
            International League for Peace and Freedom, an interracial
            organization that had been founded in 1919 by opponents of World War
            I. Similar to previous Pan-African congresses, participants
            discussed the status and conditions of black people throughout the
            world.
            <br />
            The financial crisis induced by the Great Depression and the
            military exigency generated by World War II necessitated the
            suspension of the Pan-African Congress for a period of eighteen
            years. In 1945, the organized movement was revived in Manchester,
            England. It is unclear whether DuBois or George Padmore, a West
            Indian Marxist, provided the initiative for this meeting.
            Recognizing DuBois’s historic contribution to the Pan-African
            movement, delegates named him president of the 1945 congress. The
            Manchester meeting marked a turning point in the history of the
            gatherings. For the first time representatives of political parties
            from Africa and the West Indies attended the meetings. Moreover, the
            conservative credo of the forum gave way to radical social,
            political, and economic demands. Congress participants unequivocally
            demanded an end to colonialism in Africa and urged colonial subjects
            to use strikes and boycotts to end the continent’s social, economic,
            and political exploitation by colonial powers.
            <br />
            While previous Pan-African congresses had been controlled largely by
            black middle-class British and American intellectuals who had
            emphasized the amelioration of colonial conditions, the Manchester
            meeting was dominated by delegates from Africa and Africans working
            or studying in Britain. The new leadership attracted the support of
            workers, trade unionists, and a growing radical sector of the
            African student population. With fewer African American
            participants, delegates consisted mainly of an emerging crop of
            African intellectual and political leaders, who soon won fame,
            notoriety, and power in their various colonized countries.
            <br />
            The final declaration of the 1945 congress urged colonial and
            subject peoples of the world to unite and assert their rights to
            reject those seeking to control their destinies. Congress
            participants encouraged colonized Africans to elect their own
            governments, arguing that the gain of political power for colonial
            and subject peoples was a necessary prerequisite for complete
            social, economic, and political emancipation. This politically
            assertive stance was supported by a new generation of African
            American activists such as the actor and singer Paul Robeson, the
            minister and politician Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and the educator
            and political activist William A. Hunton Jr. who took an increasing
            interest in Africa.
            <br />
            While the Pan-African congresses lacked financial and political
            power, they helped to increase international awareness of racism and
            colonialism and laid the foundation for the political independence
            of African nations. African leaders such as Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana,
            Nnamdi Azikiwe of Nigeria, and Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya were among
            several attendees of congresses who subsequently led their countries
            to political independence. In May 1963, the influence of these men
            helped galvanize the formation of the Organization of African Unity
            (OAU), an association of independent African states and nationalist
            groups.
