        Revolutionary solidarity: The Bobo Ashanti
      </h3>
      <p className="bobo-ashanti-p">
        Bobo Ashanti, or Bobo Shanti ("Bobo" meaning "black" and "Ashanti" to
        pay homage to their Ashanti ancestors of the Akan tribe in present-day
        Ghana, known for its warriors), also called the Ethiopian African Black
        International Congress (EABIC), originating in Bull Bay near Kingston,
        Jamaica. The title of Bobo Ashanti essentially means "Black warrior".
        The Bobo Ashanti are one of the strictest Mansions of Rastafari. They
        cover their dreadlocks with bright turbans and wear long robes and can
        usually be distinguished from other Rastafari members because of this.
        While some Nyabinghi and Twelve Tribe of Israel Rastas drink wine and
        are either vegetarians or omnivores (eating plants, animals, and fungi),
        the Bobo Ashanti are all strictly vegan and stick to the biblical
        restrictions regarding their vow; they also add extra restrictions to
        their diet, e.g. they do not eat mangoes or sugarcane. Twice each week
        and on the first Sunday of every month, the Bobos fast. Almost all songs
        and tributes within the community end with the phrase "Holy Emmanuel I
        Selassie I Jah I Rastafari." "I" symbolizes unity. Bobo Shanti do smoke
        marijuana like the other mansions of Rastafari, but do not do so in
        public because it is a sacred practice to be done at times of worship.
        Even though it is the "holy herb", production is not allowed in the Bobo
        Shanti commune as marijuana used to be illegal in Jamaica, although it
        is now legal for use by Rastafari. The Bobo Shanti were founded by
        Prince Emmanuel Charles Edwards in 1958 during the period known as the
        "groundation", where many protests took place calling for repatriation
        of African descendants and slaves to Kingston. Emmanuel Charles Edwards
        was the leader of the protests who was to be called King when he was
        badly beaten by authorities for his action. After this event, he formed
        the mansion of Bobo Ashanti as a separatist movement from those who did
        not strictly follow the principles of Rastafari.[8] He established the
        first Bobo Shanti community in Kingston, which then settled in Bull Bay,
        where most of the members live today.[9] The Bobo Shanti consider their
        mansion to be the "Priesthood Order" of Rastafari, as they hold the most
        radical theology and offer theological training and accreditation. Those
        who become priests, prophets, or Empresses are to abide by EABIC
        principles in their home country. The community in Bull Bay is very
        tight knit and a place of refuge for poor people, as it offers free
        shelter, food, and education. Prince Emmanuel is called "Dada" by his
        followers, which was a name taken from Idi Amin, who was called Idi Amin
        Dada. Emmanuel is also seen by the Bobos as part of a trinity - together
        with Marcus Garvey and Haile Selassie I, where Selassie is regarded as
        King, Garvey as prophet, and Emmanuel as high priest.[11] Marcus Garvey
        is praised by the Rastafarians for his call for pan-Africanism, which
        looks to unite Africans all over the world and achieve gender, social,
        and economic equality. In his Farewell Speech in 1916, Garvey announced
        the future crowning of a Black King, the spot which Haile Selassie
        filled as the leader of the Black Nation and Messiah. He is considered
        the reincarnation of the King Alpha, and Empress Menen is considered the
        reincarnation of Queen Omega
