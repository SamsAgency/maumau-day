        Revolutionary solidarity: The Nyahbinghi Order
      </h3>
      <p className="bobo-ashanti-p">
        The Nyahbinghi Order (a.k.a. Theocratic Priesthood and Livity Order of
        Nyabinghi) of Rastafarians is named for Queen Nyahbinghi of Uganda, who
        fought against colonialists in the 19th century. Nyahbinghi is the
        oldest of the Rastafarian orders and it focuses mainly on Haile
        Selassie, Ethiopia, and the eventual return to Africa. It is overseen by
        an Assembly of Elders. Nyahbinghi attempts to keep the link between
        Rastafarian faith and African heritage close. The group is named after
        Queen Nyahbinghi who ruled Uganda in the 19th Century and helped reduce
        the influence of colonial powers. The name Nyahbinghi is believed to
        mean 'Death to all Oppressors'. The focus of this group is on the
        veneration of Haile Selassie, who is regarded by them as the embodiment
        of God. Ethiopia is very important to the sect, which emphasises the
        repatriation of blacks to Africa. The Nyahbinghi regard water, air and
        fire as representations of the elements of life. Fire is believed to
        represent the wrath of Jah pouring down on Babylon. Nyahbinghi eat
        organic produce only, such as vegetables, fruits, herbs and barks, and
        avoid the consumption of salt. Nyahbinghi take part in regular
        Groundations, often called Nyahbinghi Groundations. The word
        'groundation' means affirmation of life through earth. The importance of
        Ethiopia to Nyahbinghi: The flag tends to have the colour green first.
        The Nyahbinghi flag also features a lion in the centre, reflecting the
        Lion of Judah - Haile Selassie I. Nyahbinghi observe the Ethiopian
        Sabbath, Tuesday. Nyahbinghi try to use the Ethiopian language, Amharic.
