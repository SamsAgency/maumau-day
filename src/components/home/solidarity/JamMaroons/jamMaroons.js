        Revolutionary solidarity: The Maroons of Jamaica
      </h3>
      <p className="bobo-ashanti-p">
        There is a story that when Christopher Columbus, after his second
        voyage to the New World in 1494, was asked to describe the new island he
        had found in the west, he crumpled a sheet of paper and set it before
        the Spanish king and queen. The Caribbean Island was Jamaica, with its
        magnificent and craggy mountains. Though this story, like many such
        anecdotes, has been told of other explorers and other places throughout
        the New World, it helps us to understand how, a few centuries later, a
        relatively small number of fugitive slaves could very nearly bring
        Jamaican planter society to its knees. The rugged mountains made the
        interior of the island an ideal refuge for slaves who, in the 17th and
        18th centuries, fled the plantations and created their own societies in
        the bush. These Maroons, as they were called, were not unique to
        Jamaica. They sprang up throughout the New World, not only in the
        Caribbean, but in Central and South America, and in the United States as
        well; wherever there were slave plantations, there was resistance in the
        form of slave revolts and runaways. And wherever geography permitted,
        the escaped slaves gathered together in the hush to form communities.
        The most famous of these Maroon societies, Palmares in Brazil, contained
        upwards of 10,000 people and withstood almost a century of Portuguese
        expeditions against it before it was finally destroyed in the 1690’s. On
        a smaller scale, the southern United States was dotted with settlements
        of fugitive slaves who sought shelter in the mountains and swamps where
        they sometimes mixed with Indians. While most such communities were
        destroyed by the planter societies around them, in a number of cases the
        European powers could not overcome the Maroons and were forced to sign
        treaties with them; in Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Hispaniola,
        Mexico, Jamaica and Surinam, colonial governments offered terms to
        Maroons, recognizing their freedom and the territorial integrity of
        their settlements, But it is only in two areas, Jamaica and the Guianas,
        that the descendants of Maroons have continued as separate and distinct
        communities into the present. In Jamaica, descendants of the 17th and
        18th century Maroons still live on the land their ancestors defended,
        ever conscious of their past as guerrilla fighters whom the British
        could not defeat. Cudjoe and a white officer exchanging hats as a
        gesture of friendship. Cudjoe was initially very suspicious of the
        government's overtures of peace, for he did not believe the English
        would would keep their word. It was only after his Maroon settlement was
        burned down that he agreed to come to terms. Even after the treaty, both
        sides remained wary, and perhaps because of that they often made a point
        of stressing their friendly relations. Cudjoe and a white officer

        Jamaican Maroons started with a small group of Spanish slaves who were
        left behind when the Spaniards gave up the island to the British in
        1660. Their numbers were augmented by escapees from the new British
        plantations who either joined them or established their own settlements
        in the woods. By the early lath century there were some thousand
        fugitives living in the interior. Slaves escaped singly, in groups, or
        by the hundreds in bloody rebellions. Many must have died of wounds,
        starvation and exposure following their escape, but some did survive to
        forge new lives for themselves in the interior and to create new
        societies that were largely African derived. Initially, a number of
        small bands formed, but these eventually coalesced into two major
        groups, each comprising several villages. In the eastern end of the
        island, in the Blue Mountains and the intersecting John Crow Mountains,
        the Windward Maroons built their villages and planted their fields; in
        the western interior, on the edges of a jagged limestone formation
        called the Cockpit Country, the Leeward Maroons made their settlements.
        Both these areas are so inhospitable and inaccessible that they are even
        today largely uninhabited. The Maroons were a thorn in the side of the
        British, whose plantations they raided for supplies, and whom they
        sometimes killed in the process. In addition, their presence in the
        interior was a challenge to British authority in the island, and
        encouraged plantation slaves to believe there was an alternative to the
        brutal hardship of plantation life, if only they could escape. Above
        all, the Whites feared that Maroon successes would stimulate what they
        dreaded most—an island-wide slave revolt. In the 1730’s, the activities
        of the Maroons increased sharply, and the Colonial Government shared
        with the Crown its fears: “… we are not in a Condition to defend
        ourselves, the Terror of them [the Maroons] spreads itself everywhere
        and ye Ravages and Barbarities they commit have determined several
        Planters to abandon their Plantations, The Evil is Daily Increasing and
        their success has had such Influence on our other slaves that they are
        continually deserting to them in great Numbers and ye Insolent behavior
        of others gives us but too much cause to fear a General Desertion which
        without your Majesties’ gracious Aid and assistance must render us a
        Prey to them …” The Crown might offer tax relief to help the island with
        the extra expenses incurred in trying to subdue the Maroons, but there
        remained the problem of who was to fight this formidable foe. In the
        absence of large numbers of troops from England, Jamaica had to fall
        back on its militia, and in a plantation society of masters and slaves,
        the raw materials for such a volunteer army were scarce. In the 1730’s,
        the island contained an estimated 80,000 slaves and 8000 Whites, of whom
        only 1000 were “masters of families or men of any property.” Most of the
        other Whites, aside from women and minors, were indentured servants. The
        colonial men of property, who had the greatest interest in routing the
        Maroons, were willing to serve as generals and colonels in the militia.
        but they had neither the inclination nor the numbers to fill out the
        ranks, Furthermore, they were needed at home to see to it that their
        slaves, who outnumbered the Whites ten to one, were not so encouraged by
        the Maroon successes that they tried to follow suit. The bulk of the
        White militia thus came from the island’s 1500 indentured servants, and
        they were often found lacking both in military skills and in willingness
        to risk death for their masters’ interests. The Whites that could be
        gathered for duty were not, in the opinion of a militia captain, the
        stuff of which soldiers are made. Captain Peters complained to Governor
        Hunter that instead of good shots, he had been sent “a parcel of
        Cowardly, Obstinate Fellows who neither good words nor bad will do any
        good.” But regardless of military quality, there simply were not enough
        White men to fight against the Maroons and hold the plantations at the
        same time. This version of the signing of the treaty probably portrays
        the Maroons as underdressed. They carried away clothing and cloth, as
        well as other supplies, in their plantation raids. Cudjoe was describe
        as wearing a full suit of clothes, as shown in the picture on page 21.
        The white officers, on the other hand, are accurately portrayed as
        overdressed. Their heavy clothes, consisting of many layers, were
        suitable for England but unhealthy in semi-tropical climate. This

        Their heavy clothes, consisting of many layers, were suitable for
        England but unhealthy in semi-tropical climate. Thus, the planters were
        forced to call upon their slaves and on the small number of free Blacks
        and Mulattoes to come to their aid, despite the uneasiness it caused
        them to arm the Blacks. Although they were less openly unwilling to
        fight than the Whites, the Blacks were scarcely more enthusiastic. Like
        the indentured servants, they had “no obligations either of honor or
        interest” to defend the planters’ property, and they were suspected of
        secretly aiding the Maroons. Slaves, if they distinguished themselves by
        extraordinary valor and service, might be given their freedom, but even
        in those very rare circumstances they had to continue fighting for the
        Whites. Rather than risk death for the planters’ cause, they often
        shrank from fighting, and sometimes deserted to join the Maroons. But
        despite the drawbacks in using them, free and slave Blacks comprised the
        majority of virtually every party sent out against the Maroons. In the
        1730’s, in parties of some fifty to two hundred men, usually over half
        were armed Blacks, perhaps one-third armed Whites, and the remainder
        slave baggage carriers. The parties the island raised against the
        Maroons not only failed to defeat them, they failed dismally. Their
        sheer incompetence in battle was encouraging to Maroons and plantation
        slaves alike. Frightened by their inability to contain the growing
        menace, the Colonial Assembly made desperate pleas to the Crown for
        trained troops. England sent soldiers to aid her prize colony, but they
        too proved of little use against the Maroons. Fresh from Europe, the new
        troops were extremely vulnerable to the diseases of tropical Jamaica,
        including malaria and yellow fever. Local Whites who had already
        survived a period of seasoning fared better, as did the Blacks, many of
        whom had an inherited resistance to malaria. But the new troops were
        dying like flies. One of their commanders, Colonel Cornwallis, wrote
        home, “One Can’t Set 24 Hours without hearing of Some of the Corps being
        either Sick or Dead they say every body has a Seasoning and … that
        Seasoning has hitherto Carryed off every one that has had it . . .”
        Weakened by disease, the troops were further demoralized and confused by
        the type of fighting they faced. They saw in it no opportunity for
        military honor, as they knew it. The Colonel continued, “I’m sure there
        is not an officer here but with Pleasure would go to the most desperate
        siege rather than Stay in this damned unwholesome place for then one
        should have a Chance to gain some Credit or die honourably, here no
        Reputation to be gained & no service to be done . . .” To console
        themselves the troops, both officers and men, turned to drink. This
        further incapacitated them, for the drink was rum, “the ruin of this
        island” Governor Hunter called it, and “easier to came at here than
        small beer in England.” These soldiers hunting Maroons in Surinam did
        not have to face the hardships of the Jamaica mountains, but the swamps
        posed another peril. They were the breeding ground of mosquitos and
        yellow fever. And whether in the swamps or in the mountain rains and
        dew, there was always the problem of keeping one's powder dry for those
        rare occasions on which one actually managed to encounter Maroons. Note
        the Blacks who were used as soldiers and baggage carriers. Whites were
        in the minority on most expeditions. These soldiers hunting Maroons in

        Whites were in the minority on most expeditions. The nature of the
        warfare was so discouraging that it might have defeated a much more able
        and dedicated army. In the first place, getting men and supplies into
        enemy territory was a taxing exercise in its own right. The Maroons had
        purposely located their settlements in the most inaccessible areas of
        the island, and all movement had to be on foot, over difficult and
        dangerous terrain. And getting into Maroon country was less than half
        the battle—it did not even insure that one would meet up with the enemy.
        As Governor Trelawny tried to explain to those back in England in 1738.
        “The service here is not like that in Flanders or any part of Europe.
        Here the greatest difficulty is not to beat, but to see the enemy. The
        men are forced to march up the currents of rivers over steep mountains
        and precipices without a track, through such thick woods that they are
        obliged to cut their way almost every step … the underwoods being always
        full of saps and new shoots, exceedingly tough and bushy, twisted and
        entangled in a strange manner: add to this that they frequently meet
        with torrents caused by heavy piercing rains that often fall in the
        woods and against which tents are no shelter. In short nothing can be
        done in strict conformity to the usual military preparations and
        according to a regular manner, bush-fighting as they call it being a
        thing peculiar by itself.” The river routes were said to be the easiest
        paths to follow, but the men traveling them found they might have to..
        cross the Fords above twenty times in one day & near as often every day,
        which in most places is breast high, & … they often meet with high
        Rocks, to get over which; they were forced to climb on each other’s
        hacks, & to hand up their Arms Baggage, & Ammunition. . .” These marches
        against the Maroons were called “the most laborious Service [that] can
        be well undertaken.” The best woodsmen could not march above five miles
        a day. By the time they got into Maroon country, they were fatigued with
        their March their Arms and Ammunition frequently Wett or Spoiled with
        their being obliged to lye nightly in those unsettled Woods, Exposed to
        the Rains and the usual excessive Foggs, …” At best, when a party came
        upon the Maroons it was in poor condition to fight. At worst, the men
        could suffer all this and still fail to find the enemy. One expedition.
        sent out in 1730, got lost in the woods, and an estimated quarter of the
        men died from sickness and drowning in the rivers without their ever
        encountering a Maroon! The captain of this sorry expedition was
        court-martialled and shot. A party led by Christopher Allen in 1732 had
        better luck. Allen led a group of men on a new route, over the highest
        mountains in f am aica, to the village of Nanny Town. By the time they
        sighted the village in a valley below them, they had been two weeks on
        the march, “Sick & lame, almost Starv’d.” Allen reported that their
        first thought was not how to attack the village, but “that we could get
        there to Dinner, at which we were all Overjoy’d.” But Allen’s men had to
        face a full day and night of fighting before they entered the village.
        Allen’s party was indeed one of the fortunate ones in finding a Maroon
        village. Their settlements were generally so well hidden and defended
        that parties seldom got that far. The more usual contact the government
        forces had with Maroons was as victims of their ambushes. The
        mountainous terrain provided an ideal setting for a few armed Maroons to
        turn back an entire party. Troops fully expected that they would be
        ambushed sometime on their march up the narrow gullies and steep river
        beds, and in this they were seldom disappointed. As one neared the
        settlements, the ambushes became more numerous, and it was virtually out
        of the question to creep up to them unseen. Defenses increased and
        became more sophisticated and ingenious. The village of Quao, a headman
        of the Windward Maroons, “… was so situated … that NO BODY of men, or
        scarce an individual could approach it, that they would not have five or
        six hours notice, by their out centinals: … the only accessible way to
        it, was up a very narrow path in which holes were cut, from place to
        place, about four foot deep, all the way up, and down, with crutch
        sticks set before them, for the entrenched Negroes. to rest their guns
        upon …” These Maroons, hidden behind hushes, were invisible to their
        attackers. Another common defense was to secure huge stones with props
        or ties and set them rolling down on the approaching troops. Capturing a
        Maroon village was counted a major victory by the government, but the
        most it usually accomplished was to occupy the Maroons for a few months
        while they settled in a new location. Seldom were any great number of
        Maroons taken in battle. In one such “great success” the government took
        the village. but failed to capture, or even to see, a single Maroon,
        though they engaged in active fighting with them for an hour and a half!
        The Maroons set fire to a group of houses, and under cover of smoke the
        women and children fled to nearby caves that had been prepared as a
        place of refuge, while the men held the attention of the party. Then
        they too withdrew from the village. Troops occupying a Maroon settlement
        invariably destroyed whatever crops they could, which sometimes led to
        hardship and starvation for the Maroons. But when the rains threatened
        to cut the parties off from their own supplies of food and ammunition,
        they abandoned the settlements, and the Maroons sometimes reoccupied
        them. The hardships of service in these parties were so great that many
        men forced to march against the Maroons escaped into the bush rather
        than face fighting them. Black defectors had the option of joining the
        “enemy”; the Whites could not join the Maroons, but they ran
        nevertheless. It was common for parties to lose several Whites by
        desertion in the first few days of their march, and in battle any number
        might run if they were not carefully watched. In one notorious case, a
        major expedition of two hundred seamen, specially borrowed from the
        navy, together with some hundred soldiers, turned back at the first cry
        of “Ambush ahead!” Then they fell to plundering and destroying their own
        supplies, the slave carriers having dropped them and run. They threw
        away the surgeon’s instruments and medicines, cast the meat and bread
        down a precipice, and to prevent any further advance by the party, broke
        open the ammunition boxes and scattered the powder and shot. Then,
        finding the rum, they drank all they could and marched home. All this is
        not to say that some of the government forces, both Black and White, did
        not distinguish themselves in the service. A group of free Blacks, led
        by Sambo, were professionals at bush fighting, and a number of militia
        men and officers repeatedly showed valor on long marches and in battle.
        But for most of those sent against the Maroons the march was so
        exhausting, the battle so frightening, the successes so rare and the
        rewards so small that they pulled back whenever they could. The Maroons,
        on the other hand, were fighting for their very existence. and they
        brought to this fight all their energies and resourcefulness. One
        measure of Maroon ingenuity was their ability to supply themselves with
        guns and ammunition from the plantation society, for the government made
        every effort to limit access to these dangerous goods. Maroons tried to
        carry off arms and ammunition whenever they raided settlements, and
        slaves who ran away to join them often stole arms from plantation
        stores. In addition, the government knew only too well how much of the
        party supplies found their way into Maroon hands, either carried there
        by Black deserters or left behind when the parties ran. The arms thus
        obtained would last indefinitely, given proper care, but the British
        were puzzled by the continuing supply of powder and shot until they
        learned from a captured Maroon of an ingenious method. Two captured
        White boys were made to write passes in the name of Colonel Needham,
        owner of a large plantation, for the ammunition. Maroons, pretending to
        be his men, would boldly enter Kingston and buy it from a merchant
        there. The Assembly passed laws forbidding such sales to Maroons, which
        suggests that at least several people were engaged in the trade, and
        that they might have been aware of their customers’ identity. The
        government also learned, after the fact, that the Maroons had bought
        powder and shot from an “Indian” who belonged to a sloop that stopped in
        the harbor. Men passing through the island probably asked few questions
        of potential customers. The captured Maroon also revealed that they had
        two hundred horns of powder, but were short of shot: they often fired
        their guns without shot to give the impression of firepower. This was
        one of a number of psychological techniques the Maroons used to
        undermine the morale of the parties. Another trick they used to convince
        the enemy of their superior numbers and ferocity was to make as much
        noise as possible. “When they Engaged they Constantly kept blowing
        Horns, Conch Shells, and other Instruments, which made a hideous and
        terrible noise among the Mountains in hopes of terrifying [the] Parties,
        by making them imagine their Number and Strength much greater than it
        really was.” The Maroons seemed to enjoy taunting their attackers.
        Captain Lamb reported that the Maroons on top of a hill near their
        village “… Hallow’d to us to come up for they was ready for us and told
        us three times we came for to Fight ’em and runaway like a passell of
        White liver’d Sons of Bitches, …” On another occasion they disconcerted
        the Whites by showing that they had advance knowledge of the
        government’s plan to have several parties converge on a Maroon
        settlement by different routes: a Maroon called out to admonish one
        party for arriving ahead of schedule since the party of free Blacks
        under Sambo was not due until the following day. Hidden in the bush,
        spying on the parties but invisible to them, the Maroons tried to entice
        the Black members to desert, “Inviting them by artful Expressions to
        quit a Slavish life.” One officer reported, “Several of them call’d to
        Captain Williams and it is suppos’d they are Party Negroes who have
        deserted, They call’d to our Negroes and Inquir’d after their Wives and
        acquaintance, and bid them tell them how well they live and if they will
        go to them they shall live so too, at the same time asking Our Party
        Negroes to come to them persuading them not to fight for the White Man
        …” Maroons and Blacks in the parties also called out to each other in
        African languages, which must have made the Whites even more uneasy. The
        Maroons were a society at war, and this fact was reflected in their
        social organization. The Leeward Maroons, under the leadership of their
        famous chieftain Cudjoe, had a sophisticated military organization. He
        “… Occasionally appointed as many as were necessary, of the Ablest under
        him as Captains & divided the rest into Companies, & gave each Captain,
        such a Number as he thought was proportionable to the merit he was
        possess’d of … The Chief Employment of these Captains was to Exercise
        their respective men in the Use of the Lance. & small arms after the
        manner of the Negroes on the Coast of Guinea, To Conduct the Bold &
        active in Robbing the Planta. of Slaves, Arms, Ammunition & ct. Hunting
        wild hogs, & to direct the rest with the Women in Planting Provisions—&
        Managing Domestic affairs.” Cudjoe ruled with an iron hand, and promptly
        killed any man who disobeyed his orders or challenged his authority.

        in Africa, enslaved, and shipped to the New World. There he became a
        free soldier and hunted Maroons for the Whites. Such rangers were used
        against Maroons in Jamaica also. They were considered very effective
        when they could be relied upon, but were often suspect of favoring the
        "enemy." Note the decorative scarification on this ranger of Surinam. He

        effective when they could be relied upon, but were often suspect of
        favoring the “enemy.” The Windward Maroons also subjected themselves to
        the severe discipline made necessary by the constant threat of battle.
        The head man at Nanny Town ordered the entire military operation, and
        anyone who committed a crime was shot to death. Here too, those men who
        were least noted for their courage worked with the women in raising
        provisions. The Nanny Town Maroons were well coordinated for fighting. A
        captured Maroon told of the way in which they prepared for the advance
        of troops toward their settlement: “… there were at Hobby’s [a
        plantation captured by the Maroons] 2 Gangs of Men 100 in each Gang &
        Several women which they had brought to help carry off the Spoil: . ..
        they left one Gang in the Negro Town to Guard the rest of the Women &
        Children; … they had determined on hearing the Partys coming to Ambush
        them in the River’s Course, that a Gang of 100 was to lay on Carrion
        Crow Hill & 100 more Hobby’s way, that a Drum was to be placed on the
        ridge over the Town to View the Partys and the Women in the town to burn
        the houses in case the Party should be too Strong, if not the three
        Gangs to Surround them on the beat of Drum, all under the Command of
        Scipio.” In addition to their headmen, Maroons in both ends of the
        island relied on obeah men and women, that is, magical practitioners,
        for help in their battle for survival. One of them, Nanny, after whom
        Nanny Town was named, is still revered and remembered as a heroine for
        turning back the British fire by magic. Such supernatural aids may have
        given the Maroons a boost in confidence, but the bulk of their defense
        was provided by careful planning and ingenuity and a great deal of
        courage and resourcefulness. The Jamaican government had tried virtually
        every means of defeating its internal enemy—militia, regular troops from
        England, armed slaves and free Blacks, even imported Miskito Indians—and
        all proved unable to subdue the Maroons, There remained only one course
        open—to try to make peace with them. By the late 1730’s, Governor
        Trelawny was convinced that this was the only way out for the British,
        but for a White man to convince the Maroons that such a proposal was
        genuine was a major task in itself. One such envoy was turned back with
        a threat; another was killed, and his jawbone used to adorn the horn of
        a Maroon hornsman. Finally, in February of 1739, a militia party under
        John Guthrie succeeded in finding and capturing the settlement of
        Cudjoe, headman of the Leeward Maroons. The Maroons being thus at a
        disadvantage, Guthrie managed to press them for terms. Cudjoe and
        Guthrie signed a treaty and sealed the bargain by taking an oath
        together and drinking their own blood, mixed with rum, from a calabash.
        By the treaty, the Maroons were acknowledged as legally free, granted
        land reserves at the site of their villages, and allowed to engage in
        trade with the rest of the island. The integrity of Maroon society was
        recognized, their headman being responsible for all internal matters
        except the death penalty, which was reserved to the Crown. In return,
        the Maroons agreed not to harbor any future runaways in their midst and
        to help the government in bringing to terms other Maroons still at
        large. A few months later, a similar agreement was made with the
        Windward Maroons under Quao. Thus came to an end, in 1739, an era of
        guerilla warfare in Jamaica. The Maroons had, by their persistent and
        courageous efforts, and their unconventional methods of fighting,
        defeated all British attempts to subdue them, and forced the recognition
        of their freedom, which was not accorded the slave population of Jamaica
        as a whole for another hundred years. In 1795 the Maroons of Trelawny
        Town, the largest Maroon settlement in the island, rebelled and withdrew
        into the impenetrable cockpits, from which they were finally dislodged
        only with the aid of vicious hunting dogs. They were deported to Nova
        Scotia and finally Sierra Leone, and the controversy surrounding their
        deportation led Dallas to write his book, The History of the Maroons.
