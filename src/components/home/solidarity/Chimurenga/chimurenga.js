        Revolutionary solidarity: The Chimurenga War
      </h3>
      <p className="bobo-ashanti-p">
        Chimurenga is a word in the Shona language. The Ndebele equivalent,
        though not as widely used since the majority of Zimbabweans are Shona
        speaking, is Umvukela, roughly meaning "revolutionary struggle" or
        uprising. In specific historical terms, it also refers to the Ndebele
        and Shona insurrections against administration of the British South
        Africa Company during the late 1890s—the Second Matabele War, or First
        Chimurenga—and the war fought between African nationalist guerrillas and
        the predominantly white Rhodesian government during the 1960s and
        1970s—the Rhodesian Bush War, or Second Chimurenga/Imvukela. The concept
        is also occasionally used in reference to the land reform programme
        undertaken by the Government of Zimbabwe since 2000, which some call a
        Third Chimurenga. Proponents of land reform regard it as the final phase
        in what they hold to be the liberation of Zimbabwe through economic and
        agrarian reforms intended to empower indigenous people, despite the
        economic collapse that soon followed, which some have labeled the Third
        "Chimurenga" as being the catalyst. However the work opinion is
        different Many view the snatching if land from white farners who were
        backbone of rhodeshian economy when the high quality farm fruit veg from
        rhodeshia found place in markets of Europe and USA Analysts say that the
        farm policy of Mugabe to give farms to undeserving people who did know
        much if farming led to semi of high quality farming of past. Many lands
        taken from whites remain fallow and unused This has led to the slowdown
        of basically agrarian Zimbabwe economy And a change in the mindset is
        needed Some say inclusive economy that gives equal rights to whites and
        black alike will only see Zimbabwe economy rise . In a modern context,
        the word may denote a struggle for human rights, political dignity and
        social justice.[1] The expression is also used in context with modern
        Zimbabwean music, Chimurenga music
