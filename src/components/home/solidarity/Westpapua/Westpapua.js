        Revolutionary solidarity: The West Papua
      </h3>
      <p className="bobo-ashanti-p">
        Early days West Papua was originally populated by Melanesian people some
        tens of thousands of years ago. After little contact with the Western
        world, it was finally formally colonised by the Netherlands in 1898. The
        islands that now make up Indonesia were also colonised by the Dutch but
        when the Republic of Indonesia became an independent nation state in
        1949, West Papua did not join the country. The Dutch government
        recognised that West Papua was geographically, ethnically and culturally
        very different to Indonesia and so the Dutch government began preparing
        West Papua for its own independence throughout the 1950s. At the end of
        1961, West Papua held a Congress at which its people declared
        independence, and raised their new flag – the Morning Star. But within
        months the dream was dead. The Indonesian government wanted all of the
        former Dutch colonies in the Asia-Pacific region and the Indonesian
        military soon invaded West Papua. Conflict broke out between the
        Netherlands, Indonesia and the indigenous population regarding control
        of the territory. Unable to secure enough support for its invasion of
        West Papua, the Indonesian government turned to the Soviet Union for
        help. It was the height of the Cold War and the US government was
        worried that Indonesia seeking Soviet Union support might increase the
        spread of communism in South East Asia. In a letter from the American
        President to the Dutch Prime Minister, the US government strongly urged
        the Dutch government to hand over West Papua to Indonesia, in an attempt
        to appease a communist friendly Indonesian government. The US government
        managed to engineer a meeting between Indonesia and the Netherlands
        resulting in the New York Agreement, which in 1962 gave control of West
        Papua to the United Nations and one year later transferred control to
        Indonesia. The Papuans were never consulted. However, the agreement did
        promise them their right to self determination – a right which is
        guaranteed by the UN to all people in the world. Act of No Choice By
        1969 there was widespread resistance to Indonesian rule. The Indonesian
        military had killed and imprisoned thousands of Papuans in the seven
        years it had occupied the country – yet it was under these conditions
        that the people were supposed to exercise their right to self
        determination. It was agreed that the UN should oversee a plebiscite of
        the people of West Papua, in which they would be given two choices: to
        remain part of Indonesia or to become an independent nation. This vote
        was to be called the ‘Act of Free Choice.’ Protests at Act of Free
        Choice West Papuans holding placards, calling for UN assitance, after
        Indonesia’s invasion of West Papua in 1962 But the Act was a sham.
        Instead of overseeing a free and fair election, the UN stood by while
        Indonesia rigged the vote. Declaring that the Papuans were too
        ‘primitive’ to cope with democracy, the Indonesian military hand-picked
        just 1,026 ‘representative’ people, out of a population of one million,
        bribed them and threatened to kill them and their families if they voted
        the wrong way. So strong was the intimidation that despite widespread
        opposition to Indonesian rule, all 1,026 voted to remain a part of
        Indonesia. Despite protests from the Papuans, a critical report by a UN
        official and condemnation of the vote in the international media, the UN
        shamefully sanctioned the result and West Papua has remained under
        control of the Indonesian state ever since. The Papuans now dub this
        episode ‘the Act of No Choice’. Consigning the fate of a million people
        to live under the brutal occupation that ensued is one of the most
        shameful chapters in the history of the UN. Recently there have been a
        number of detailed reports that heavily criticise the actions of
        Indonesia, the UN, and its member states during this period. The
        principal aim of the Free West Papua Campaign is to persuade the UN to
        review its role in this event and for the world allow the Papuans a true
        act of self determination. The People and Land Under Attack Freeport
        Mine Environmental destruction at the Freeport mine Since the first days
        of Indonesian occupation, the people and land of West Papua have been
        under relentless attack. In an attempt to control the Papuans, and to
        claim the land to make way for resource extraction, the Indonesian army
        has systematically murdered, raped and tortured people in numbers that
        could constitute a genocide. One of the worst examples of this is the
        displacement and killing of thousands of people to make way for the
        giant American- and British-owned Freeport mine, the largest gold mine
        in the world, which has reduced a sacred mountain to a crater and
        poisoned the local river system. In a further attempt to eradicate
        Papuan culture, around one million people from overcrowded shanty towns
        across Indonesia have been moved into ‘transmigration’ camps cut into
        the forests. Resistance to Indonesian Colonialism Resistance to the
        Indonesian occupation started from the first days after the invasion. An
        armed guerrilla group called the OPM (Free Papua Movement) was formed in
        1970 to resist the colonisation of West Papua. The OPM carried out a
        number of guerrilla attacks on the Indonesian military and on the
        holdings of multinational companies who had taken Papuan land and
        resources – including a successful attempt to close down the Freeport
        gold and copper mine. Armed mostly with bows and arrows, the small,
        ragged but determined OPM fought an almost unknown war against the
        well-armed, Western-backed Indonesian military for decades. Recent Years
        Following the fall of the Indonesian military dictator, General Suharto,
        in 1998, a political space briefly opened up in West Papua. The Morning
        Star flag was flown again and a huge public congress was held in the
        year 2000 with hundreds of delegates from tribes all across Papua. The
        Congress rejected the result of the 1969 Act of Free Choice and
        reaffirmed West Papua as an independent nation. It also gave power to
        the newly formed Papuan Presidium Council (PDP) to gain world
        recognition for West Papua’s independence. But these hopes were soon
        dashed. Fearing secession, the army moved in, and hundreds of people
        were shot and arrested for public flag raisings and independence
        rallies. Then, in November 2001, the charismatic president of the PDP,
        Theys Eluay, was assassinated by Indonesian soldiers. Independence
        aspirations continued to be publicly demonstrated and whilst on the
        ground the police and military continued to respond with violence and
        intimidation, the Indonesian state attempted to quell these hopes by
        passing special autonomy legislation. The legislation was supposed to
        devolve some power and distribute more resources to West Papua but it is
        widely regarded as a failure by the indigenous Papuans with corruption
        leading to money being hoarded or misspent. In recent years a new
        independence organisation, the KNPB (National Committee for West Papua)
        has become prominent. Under its guidance huge independence rallies have
        been held across West Papua and the West Papuan’s voice is united more
        than ever. As a result, many of its members have been arrested, tortured
        and killed. In 2012, the KNPB chairman Mako Tabuni was killed by
        Indonesian police, whilst many others face lengthy jail sentences of up
        to fifteen years just for raising the West Papuan flag. Today West
        Papua’s tragedy continues with ongoing reports of villages being burnt,
        Papuans being arrested, tortured and shot and the beautiful natural
        wilderness being devastated by logging, mining, agricultural and biofuel
        interests. But there is good news too. The issue of West Papua is
        creeping up the international agenda as campaign groups, Papuan
        leaders-in-exile and concerned people all over the world alert their
        leaders to the injustice that is happening in West Papua. Despite a ban
        on foreign journalists, media outlets are beginning to cover the story
        and have exposed leaked videos of West Papuans being tortured. With the
        advent of the International Parliamentarians for West Papua (IPWP) and
        the International Lawyers for West Papua (ILWP) politicians and lawyers
        are beginning to engage with the issue. In 2016 an historic meeting was
        held at the British parliament in Westminster where West Papuan leaders
        and other leaders from Pacific countries and elsewhere gathered together
        and affirmed their support for the people of West Papua being able to
        choose their own future to live in a free and Independent nation. Things
        are moving in the right direction – but they need to move faster if more
        bloodshed is to be avoided, and the people of West Papua’s cry for
        freedom is finally to be heard.
